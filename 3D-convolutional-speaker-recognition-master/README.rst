General View
--------------

We leveraged 3D convolutional architecture for creating the speaker model in order to simultaneously
capturing the speech-related and temporal information from the speakers' utterances.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Speaker Verification Protocol(SVP)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In this work, a 3D Convolutional Neural Network (3D-CNN)
architecture has been utilized for text-independent speaker
verification in three phases.

     1. At the **development phase**, a CNN is trained
     to classify speakers at the utterance-level.

     2. In the **enrollment stage**, the trained network is utilized to directly create a
     speaker model for each speaker based on the extracted features.

     3. Finally, in the **evaluation phase**, the extracted features
     from the test utterance will be compared to the stored speaker
     model to verify the claimed identity.

The aforementioned three phases are usually considered as the SV protocol. One of the main
challenges is the creation of the speaker models. Previously-reported approaches create
speaker models based on averaging the extracted features from utterances of the speaker,
which is known as the d-vector system.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
How to leverage 3D Convolutional Neural Networks?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In our paper, we propose the implementation of 3D-CNNs for direct speaker model creation
in which, for both development and enrollment phases, an identical number of
speaker utterances is fed to the network for representing the spoken utterances
and creation of the speaker model. This leads to simultaneously capturing the
speaker-related information and building a more robust system to cope with
within-speaker variation. We demonstrate that the proposed method significantly
outperforms the d-vector verification system.

Input Pipeline for this work

The MFCC features can be used as the data representation of the spoken utterances at the frame level. However, a
drawback is their non-local characteristics due to the last DCT 1 operation for generating MFCCs. This operation disturbs the locality property and is in contrast with the local characteristics of the convolutional operations. The employed approach in this work is to use the log-energies, which we
call MFECs. The extraction of MFECs is similar to MFCCs
by discarding the DCT operation. The temporal features are
overlapping 20ms windows with the stride of 10ms, which are
used for the generation of spectrum features. From a 0.8-
second sound sample, 80 temporal feature sets (each forms
a 40 MFEC features) can be obtained which form the input
speech feature map. Each input feature map has the dimen-
sionality of ζ × 80 × 40 which is formed from 80 input
frames and their corresponding spectral features, where ζ is
the number of utterances used in modeling the speaker during
the development and enrollment stages.



The **speech features** have been extracted using [SpeechPy]_ package.

.. _Slim: https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/tree/master/tensorflow/contrib/slim

The Slim_ high-level API made our life very easy. The following script has been used for our
implementation:

.. code:: python

        net = slim.conv2d(inputs, 16, [3, 1, 5], stride=[1, 1, 1], scope='conv11')
        net = PReLU(net, 'conv11_activation')
        net = slim.conv2d(net, 16, [3, 9, 1], stride=[1, 2, 1], scope='conv12')
        net = PReLU(net, 'conv12_activation')
        net = tf.nn.max_pool3d(net, strides=[1, 1, 1, 2, 1], ksize=[1, 1, 1, 2, 1], padding='VALID', name='pool1')

        ############ Conv-2 ###############
        ############ Conv-1 ###############
        net = slim.conv2d(net, 32, [3, 1, 4], stride=[1, 1, 1], scope='conv21')
        net = PReLU(net, 'conv21_activation')
        net = slim.conv2d(net, 32, [3, 8, 1], stride=[1, 2, 1], scope='conv22')
        net = PReLU(net, 'conv22_activation')
        net = tf.nn.max_pool3d(net, strides=[1, 1, 1, 2, 1], ksize=[1, 1, 1, 2, 1], padding='VALID', name='pool2')

        ############ Conv-3 ###############
        ############ Conv-1 ###############
        net = slim.conv2d(net, 64, [3, 1, 3], stride=[1, 1, 1], scope='conv31')
        net = PReLU(net, 'conv31_activation')
        net = slim.conv2d(net, 64, [3, 7, 1], stride=[1, 1, 1], scope='conv32')
        net = PReLU(net, 'conv32_activation')
        # net = slim.max_pool2d(net, [1, 1], stride=[4, 1], scope='pool1')

        ############ Conv-4 ###############
        net = slim.conv2d(net, 128, [3, 1, 3], stride=[1, 1, 1], scope='conv41')
        net = PReLU(net, 'conv41_activation')
        net = slim.conv2d(net, 128, [3, 7, 1], stride=[1, 1, 1], scope='conv42')
        net = PReLU(net, 'conv42_activation')
        # net = slim.max_pool2d(net, [1, 1], stride=[4, 1], scope='pool1')

        ############ Conv-5 ###############
        net = slim.conv2d(net, 128, [4, 3, 3], stride=[1, 1, 1], normalizer_fn=None, scope='conv51')
        net = PReLU(net, 'conv51_activation')

        # net = slim.conv2d(net, 256, [1, 1], stride=[1, 1], scope='conv52')
        # net = PReLU(net, 'conv52_activation')

        # Last layer which is the logits for classes
        logits = tf.contrib.layers.conv2d(net, num_classes, [1, 1, 1], activation_fn=None, scope='fc')


As it can be seen, ``slim.conv2d`` has been used. However, simply by using 3D kernels as ``[k_x, k_y, k_z]``
and ``stride=[a, b, c]`` it can be turned into a 3D-conv operation. The base of the ``slim.conv2d`` is
``tf.contrib.layers.conv2d``. Please refer to official Documentation_ for further details.
